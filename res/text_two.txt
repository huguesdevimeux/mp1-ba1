In the mean time, I was there. Yes, me. I looked at the window, wondering why this day was fated to be so gloomy. Gray clouds start filling the horizon, the rumbling noise of the thunder could already be heard from far away.
What did I do to deserve this! Stuck here, in class, working on a punishment just for playing a little prank to a friend! I am sure, by the time I will be done, rain will be pouring down so hard it won't take a minute to get wet to the bones.
Today is really not my lucky day.
